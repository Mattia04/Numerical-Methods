    This website is still work-in-progress, so any information could be wrong, partial or omitted.

## Introduction

This website was created to give a guide on what to learn for physics 
students interested in the field of programming for physics.
Other students like mathematicians and engineers can also use this guide, 
for some topics they are interested in.

!!! note
    This guide assumes that you already have a basic experience in programming with `python` and `C++`.

    ??? question "Why `C++` and `python`?"
        I choose those two programming languages to write the guide because they are what I use, so I know them, 
        but they are also what the majority of physicists use.  

        `C++` is fast, ideal for simulations and other computation-heavy tasks, (it is also object-oriented).
        
        `python` is easy and has a lot of libraies, ideal for graphs, data analysis and other miscellaneous tasks.

        Obviously you are not forced to use those two, there are really good alternatives like: `C`, `julia`, `MATLAB` and `Fortran`. 

    If you don't, you can follow some online tutorials, there a lot of them online for free, learn about: 
    data types, operations, input-output, conditionals, loops, functions and lambdas, scopes, basic data structures, standard library, and error handling.

    There is also a page dedicated to a brief review of some basic concepts [see this page](000_Basics.md)

Do you want to start learning? [see this page](../old/001_Scientific_Programming.md).

## Navigation on this website

At the end of each lesson there are two arrows to go to the next and previous page.

You can also navigate thru the pages with the list on the left, and thru the section of the current page with the list on the right.

Or you can even search for something using the search bar on the top.

You can toggle light-dark mode using the icon on top, near the search bar.
